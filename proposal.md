<h2>Shalabuck Proposal</h2>

<p>
The purpose of this project is to create an ERC721 token called the "Shalabuck".
</p>

<p>
The Shalabuck will not be fungible, and each token will have unique properties that are not found in any other tokens.
</p>

<p>
The Shalabuck will store certain properties that allow us to classify and sort them (ex: "Thanks for being my friend" tokens vs "Thanks for helping me with my Back-End Web Homework" tokens). Descriptions will be stored in metadata.
</p>

<p>
The benefit of deploying this project to the ethereum blockchain is that tokens can be transferred directly via API calls in a secure manner.
</p>

<p>
Future iterations will include customized rendering on the front-end.
